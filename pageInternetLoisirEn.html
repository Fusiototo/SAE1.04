                <p class="textSansImage">
                    I discovered video games when I was 6 years old thanks to my older brother.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He is 6 years older than me, so he was always introducing me to new things.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So I started playing video games with the Nintendo DS and with games like Advance War 2, Castlevania, Worms, Mario kart, Final Fantasy III or Crash Bendicoot.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1 or 2 years later my brother introduced me to the Playstation 2, where I discovered the Ratchet and Clank franchise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Around the same time I discovered Minecraft, Age of Empire 2 and League of Legend on Computer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A few years later I switched to Playstation 3, still with the Rachet and Clank franchise, I also discovered the Call of Duty franchise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And several years later I was able to buy a gaming computer and I was able to play old games again (minecraft, Age of Empire 2, League of Legend).

            <div><strong><h3 class="sousTitreLoisir" id="2">What are the advantages and disadvantages of video games?</h3></strong></div>
                <p class="textSansImage">
                    Video games have many advantages and disadvantages
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A famous sentence says: "Videos make you violent", this sentence is only partially true, it depends on the game we play. If for example we play "Farming simulator", (the game is a simulation of a farm where we have to make it evolve), I don't see how this game can make us violent, but I understand that a game can make us violent if the person plays "Call of Duty", (it's a first person shooter video game where the goal is to kill other people)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A certain form of addiction can be created if you play video games too often
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Video games can help introverts make friends online
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can learn new languages through video games, I have always played minecraft in English,
                    so since I started playing Minecraft I was unconsciously learning English
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Games can make us more focused, more strategic, more logical or even creative
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Video games have a great influence on our morale, they can give us satisfaction when we finish a level or when we accomplish a long task, they can make us happy, sad or they can make us feel angry.

                <h1 class="sousSousTitreLoisir">N°1 : Minecraft</h1>
                    <p class="texteEtImage">
                        Minecraft is a sandbox adventure video game (completely free construction) developed by the Swedish Markus Persson, alias Notch, and then by the company Mojang Studios. It is a universe composed only of cubes and is procedurally generated, which integrates a crafting system based on the exploitation and transformation of natural resources (mineralogical, fossil, animal and vegetable).

                <h1 class="sousSousTitreLoisir">N°2 : League of Legend</h1>
                    <p class="texteEtImage">
                        The game's main mode sees two 5-player teams compete in real time in games lasting about half an hour, with each team occupying and defending its own base on the map. Each of the ten players controls one of more than 150 characters. These characters, known as "champions" in the game, have unique skills and play styles. They gain power over the course of the game by collecting experience points and purchasing items in order to defeat the opposing team. The objective of a game is to destroy the enemy "Nexus", a large structure located in the center of each base.

                    <p class="texteEtImage">
                        The game's action takes place in a historical setting during the Middle Ages, with the player having to evolve a civilization through four ages - the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, the Castle Age and the Imperial Age - in order to unlock new technologies and units to build an empire. Thirty-five civilizations are available in the game, each based on medieval civilizations such as the Aztecs, Goths, Persians and Khmers. Like its predecessor, the game has been well received by the specialized press and the public thanks to its historical context.

                    Thanks to video games, I was able to meet new people. I met people
                    who have the same passion as me. Some people I met 6-7 years ago on the internet
                    I still play with them now. We talked at the beginning thanks to Skype and now
                    with Discord.
